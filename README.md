## Overview

This research project, sponsored by the Utah Division of Air Quality (UDAQ), involved collaboration between Utah State University (USU) and Weber State University (WSU) to measure and analyze ammonia (NH3) emissions from diesel and gasoline vehicles under conditions specific to Utah. 

The study aimed to clarify ammonia (NH3) emissions and their impact on particulate matter formation in northern Utah. By conducting laboratory and on-road tests, it aimed to characterize these emissions and guide better air quality strategies for the state.

### Objectives

* Model of Utah's diesel and gasoline passenger vehicle categories. A test fleet of gasoline and diesel vehicles representative of northern Utah's population.

* Develop NH3 calibration procedure; for verification, validation, and evaluating [Picarro G2103 cavity ring-down spectrometer (CRDS)](docs/datasheet/Picarro_G2103_Analyzer_Datasheet_ Shane Smiskol ).

* Off-road laboratory (dynamometer) measurements of diesel and gasoline vehicle NH3 emissions.

* Quantifying real driving emissions of NH3 from diesel and gasoline vehicles with respect to power levels (vehicle-specific power).
