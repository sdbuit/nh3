# **nh3**

Utah Division of Air Quality examined mobile source emission on-road of NH3 and the more typical emission gases ($NO_x,\ CO,\ CO_2,\ HO$).

## Objectives

* Model of Utah's diesel and gasoline vehicle passenger vehicle categories.  Test vehicle vehicle fleet of gasoline and diesel vehicles representaive of northern Utah's population.

* Develop NH3 calibration procedures, protocols, and validation tests for precision and accuracy.

* Laboratory (dynamometer) measurement of diesel and gasoline vehicle $NH_3$ emissions.

* Quantification of real driving emissions of NH3 from diesel and gasoline vehicles with respect to power levels (vehicle specific power).
