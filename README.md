## Objectives

* Model of Utah's diesel and gasoline passenger vehicle categories. A test fleet of gasoline and diesel vehicles representative of northern Utah's population.

* Develop NH3 calibration procedures, protocols, and validation tests for precision and accuracy.

* Off-road laboratory (dynamometer) measurements of diesel and gasoline vehicle NH3 emissions.

* Quantifying real driving emissions of NH3 from diesel and gasoline vehicles with respect to power levels (vehicle-specific power).
